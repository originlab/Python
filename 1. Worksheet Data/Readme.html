Access to data in an Origin worksheet are mostly in the form of a list, or a Pandas Data Frame. 
So you must install pandas first. See <a href="https://www.originlab.com/python/doc/originpro/classoriginpro_1_1worksheet_1_1_w_sheet.html">worksheet</a>
For function like new_sheet, see <a href="https://www.originlab.com/python/doc/originpro/namespacemembers.html">project</a>
