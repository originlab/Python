## Origin Python Samples

Code examples for using the **originpro** Python package to interact with Origin software.

These examples will work with either the built-in Python interpreter in Origin, or via an external Python interpreter. All of the examples will work *as is* with the embedded interpreter. When using them with an external interpreter, some simple modification is required as illustrated in the [External Python Code Samples documentation](https://www.originlab.com/doc/ExternalPython/External-Python-Code-Samples). 

### Running the Examples

The easiest way to run these examples is to [**download this repo as a zip file**](https://github.com/originlab/Python-Samples/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Then, simply unzip the files and open the desired file from the File menu in **Code Builder**. Then, hit **F5** to run the example.

*Note that some examples require the installation of additional Python packages.*
